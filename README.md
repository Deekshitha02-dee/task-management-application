# task-management-application

Creating the entire codebase for a web application like the Task Management Application would be quite extensive, but I can provide you with a basic example to get you started. I'll give you a simple example using Node.js for the back-end with Express.js framework and MongoDB for the database, and for the front-end, I'll use HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Please note that this example will cover only the basic functionalities (CRUD operations) and lacks many features such as authentication, error handling, and validation. Also, this example doesn't include the deployment process.

This is a basic example to help you get started. You can expand upon this codebase by adding more features, improving error handling, implementing user authentication, and enhancing the user interface. Additionally, you might want to use a front-end framework like React or Vue.js for a more dynamic and interactive user experience.
